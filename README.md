# Financial Analysis of Divis Lab

A rise in the world recession has been attributed to the Covid-19 Pandemic. In the wake of the pandemic, a number of companies emerged, but a number of companies have also collapsed, gone bankrupt, or have been dissolved. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the situation, identify the causes of failures and identify opportunities, we need to examine this situation closely as computer science students and future analysts. Thus, we conducted a study on Divi's Laboratories, the second largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization. In this project, we seek to analyze how a company grew so fast during the pandemic period.
